"""
A Pythagorean triplet is a set of three natural numbers, a < b < c, for which,
a^2 + b^2 = c^2

For example, (3^2 + 4^2 = 9 + 16) = (25 = 5^2).

There exists exactly one Pythagorean triplet for which a + b + c = 1000.
Find the product abc.

"""

"""
So the logic is going through that simple statement of a + b + c = 1000

Then check a^2 + b^2 = c^2

What would be the best way of going about this?
